<!-- Make your first HTML project, add the necessary head tags - give a suitable title, favicon and link the stylesheet.
Make the User interface as shown in the figma.
Create 3 sections, one for the top most div, the second for the image and the third for the trivia
Make sure that the Read More of the top most div is an anchor tag which leads to this wikipedia link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle
Then make the image section - in which you can also change the image but the image src should be of the breed beagle.
The third section is the trivia - make sure this is an ordered list.
Also make sure the ui is the same, ie the places where the word is bold should be bold, the places where italics is used use italics and so on. -->

            <p>
                The <span>Beagle</span> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The <span>beagle</span> was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the <span>beagle</span> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <span>beagle</span> is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
